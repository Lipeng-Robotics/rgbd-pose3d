# 3D Human Pose Estimation in RGBD Images for Robotic Task Learning

![Teaser](teaser.png)

This is a ROS node wrapping the approach presented in our paper for estimating 3D Human Pose from a single RGB-D frame. See the [project page](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/projects/rgbd-pose3d/) for additional information.
